    <h2>Ids and Classes in HTML</h2>
    <!-- ids and class both are content specifiers. Ids are specifc than classes because :-
    1. Ids are unique for each element.
    2. instead of ids there can be multiple elements with the same class -->

    <!-- ids are donated with "."dot and classes are donated with "#"hashtag -->
    <div id="container" class="box, box1, box2"></div>
